Project Overview
This project involves the planning, execution, and delivery of a pilot IT system for VR1Family Charity Aid Services, which is aimed at improving the efficiency of humanitarian aid distribution. The system is being developed as part of a project management exercise within the SWEN90016 â€“ Software Processes and Management course at the University of Melbourne.

Project Goals
The primary goal of the project is to reduce operational overhead in aid distribution from 30% to under 10% by implementing a streamlined IT system. The pilot phase focuses on delivering core functionalities that will allow VR1Family to test and demonstrate the system's capabilities within Australia, with potential for future expansion.

Key Contributions
Project Initiation:
Led the initial phase of the project, including setting objectives, scope, and success criteria to align with organizational strategy.
Stakeholder Analysis:
Conducted detailed stakeholder analysis to identify and address the needs of key stakeholders, including project sponsors, development teams, donors, and aid recipients.
Product Backlog Management:
Developed and managed the product backlog, prioritizing tasks based on business needs and ensuring timely completion of key deliverables across sprints.
Project Assumptions and Constraints Management:
Identified and managed critical assumptions and constraints, such as budget, timeline, technical capabilities, and user engagement, to ensure smooth project execution.
SDLC Model
The Agile Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) was selected for its flexibility and iterative approach, which is well-suited for accommodating evolving project requirements and stakeholder feedback.

Technology Stack
Frontend: React was chosen for its ability to create dynamic user interfaces and its compatibility with various web technologies.
Backend: Spring Boot was utilized for its robust security features and modular architecture, facilitating rapid development and deployment.
Project Management Tools
Confluence: Used for project documentation and collaboration.
Jira: Employed for tracking sprint progress, managing tasks, and maintaining a Kanban board to monitor backlog and sprint completion.
Team Reflection
The project provided valuable insights into effective team collaboration, Agile project management, and the importance of stakeholder communication in delivering a successful software product. Through this exercise, the team was able to overcome challenges such as time constraints and technical complexities, ultimately delivering a functional pilot system.
